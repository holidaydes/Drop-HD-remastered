# Drop HD remastered

LibGDX game remastered version

## Getting Started

Back in 2015, I made a sample project, which is based on a libGDX example project. That game was made to android.
This is the remastered version of that program in HD. Added many features, like difficulty chooser, custom difficulty setting, buttons, etc.. 
Enjoy to the game. :)

### Prerequisites

* Java SE Runtime Environment 21 (x64)
* Java SE Development Kit 21
* Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA IDE
* Gradle (if IDE does not contain it)

### Running the project

In terminal run this command:
```
gradlew desktop:run
```
Or just run DesktopLauncher in IDE.

### Build distribution

In terminal run this command:
```
gradlew desktop:dist
```
This will create a runnable JAR file located in the desktop/build/libs/ folder.
More tweaks are find in here: [Gradle on the Commandline](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-on-the-Commandline#packaging-for-the-desktop)
